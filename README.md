|      Action      |  Key  |
|:----------------:|:-----:|
| Downwards        | Shift |
| Upwards          | Space |
| Forward          |   Up  |

| Strafe right     |   D   |
| Strafe left      |   A   |

| Lights up        |   2   |
| Close gripper    |   3   |
| Open gripper     |   4   |
| Tilt camera down |   5   |
| Tilt camera up   |   6   |

# SITL integration:

    Before opening Bluesim (it launches its own SITL instance), run:

 `sim_vehicle.py -j6 -L RATBeach -v ArduSub -f vectored_6dof JSON --out=udpout:0.0.0.0:14550`

# External Levels

External levels can be loaded by placing a .pck file in the "levels" folder at the same level as the simulator executable (the folder is created at first run if it does not exist).

The pck file must have a `custom_level.tscn` scene, which will be loaded in runtime and added as a child to `baselevel.tscn`, which contains the ROV, water, sky, and other basic functionality.
The root node at "custom_level.tscn" should preferably be a spatial node with all your custom 3D scene within it.
